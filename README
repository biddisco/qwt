CMake integration
-----------------

I just use this in my CMakeLists for a project that needs qwt

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build/Download qwt                                                                                                                                                                         
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if(EXISTS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/qwt)
  message(STATUS "Using QWT in source tree")
  set(FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_QWT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/qwt)
  set(FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED_QWT ON) 
endif()

fetchcontent_declare(
  qwt 
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/biddisco/qwt.git
  GIT_TAG svn-cmake
)
fetchcontent_getproperties(qwt)
if(NOT qwt_POPULATED)
  fetchcontent_populate(qwt)
  add_subdirectory(${qwt_SOURCE_DIR} ${qwt_BINARY_DIR})
endif()

# ... then later in the CMakeLists

target_link_libraries(
  my_application
  PUBLIC qwt
)

Original README follows from here

The Qwt Widget Library
----------------------

      Qwt is an extension to the libraries of the Qt Project.  

      The Qwt library contains widgets and components which are 
      primarily useful for technical and scientifical purposes.
      It includes a 2-D plotting widget, different kinds of sliders, 
      and much more.

      Qwt is hosted at http://qwt.sf.net
